# Poker-Hand-Ranking
This repository contains a Python implementation of a poker hand strength evaluator. The code can determine the strength of a given poker hand, allowing for accurate hand rankings. Additionally, it includes a comprehensive test suite to verify the correctness of the hand evaluation algorithms across various scenarios.

## Next steps
I plan on creating a playable interface with in game logic that allows users to play the game. After that, I would want to create a basic level bot that a user could play against using pot odds and other mathematical poker methods.
